After what I did, my family will never look into my eyes.
Please give me new ones, so that they forget. 
...so that I can forget.
----------------------
I lost my eyes serving the king and country. 
Please, help me so that I can ride into battle once more.
----------------------
I dedicated my whole life to pursuing beauty, yet I still have to bear these filthy servant eyes. 
Give me some new ones - ones that are more deserving of me.
----------------------
I lost my left eye in a game of dice. So... which of these are currently on sale?
---------------------- 
Hi, you won't believe it, this time I lost both my eyes playing cards with the mad god Azathoth himself (lol). 
So, what eyes have you got in stock? Get me some powerful ones.
----------------------
Please, help me. I can't feed my family if I can't even see the turnip growing on my little field.
----------------------
Reading books is my whole life. But now, my eyes are failing me. Is there possibly a chance you could save me from that future?
